    <ol>
        <li>Begin by getting a shallow pan and filling it with cooking oil. Place your heat to high, and when small bubbles appear, deep fry the tofu cubes until brown and crisp.
        </li>
        <li>Get a separate pan and make it nice and hot over medium heat. Sauté onion and garlic in oil and drop the fried tofu and chilies next. Toss and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Add Knorr Liquid Seasoning according to your taste. Turn off the heat, then add Lady's Choice Mayonnaise and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with calamansi and egg (optional), and that's our dish! All you need is a big serving of rice because you will definitely eat more than usual.

            Eating it hot will surely get the most out of the flavors while happily knowing that replacing meat with this Tofu Sisig recipe means a heartier meal. Don’t stop there! Explore our vegan-friendly recipes like Mushroom Ramen and Vegetable Canneloni! </li>
